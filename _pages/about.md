Welcome! I'm Siva, an engineer with a passion for sustainable development and energy systems. I hold a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University, Indianapolis, and an MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development from the University of Cambridge. My educational background has given me a comprehensive foundation in both practical engineering and the theoretical concepts of sustainability.

I embarked on my professional journey at Grid System Operator, Malaysia as an Energy Management Systems Operator. There, my responsibilities spanned across ensuring the reliability of SCADA, EMS, and generator interconnectivity to the Malaysian grid network. The experience allowed me to apply my academic knowledge into practice while developing an understanding of grid systems and electricity markets.

Shifting gears, I found my way to the University of Cambridge, where my focus shifted towards sustainable development. I conducted research examining people's responses to different demand response programs in a simulated environment. This project allowed me to delve deeper into how society can interact with, and influence, the sustainability of our power systems.

In the fall of 2022, I joined the Mays Group, driven by my desire to explore the interaction between electricity markets and sustainable consumption of electricity. I'm continually fascinated by the potential for policy and technological solutions to address energy consumption issues and am excited about contributing towards this transformation.

When I am not engrossed in my research or work, I revel in a variety of hobbies that help me unwind and stay balanced. I have a particular fondness for table tennis, which I frequently enjoy playing with my friends. I am also an avid outdoorsman who loves to explore trails, sometimes even turning these explorations into spontaneous running sessions. As a testament to my Electrical Engineering roots, I love to tinker with electronics in my free time, which often leads to intriguing, innovative ideas.
